# trix

This is the third rough draft. There's always more coming soon and a
lot of long-term plans for the future. I want to put this out now 
because I think some of it might be useful as-is, and because I don't
want to lose it all in a fire or whatever.


#### doc

Some documentation is available. More is coming as time permits.
