 --------- NEW DEVELOPMENT - UNDER CONSTRUCTION! ---------

		I'm rearranging code, creating a new `Bot` class.
		It's not ready for use yet, does nothing, and may
		cause your computer (if not the whole universe)
		to explode.
		
		The old irc module stuff still works pretty much
		as before, though there may be new bugs i haven't 
		noticed yet.


As before...

  This `irc` subpackage is under construction.
  It's still buggy, but closer than before.
  There's a long way to go yet.
