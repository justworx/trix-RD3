 --------- UNDER CONSTRUCTION! ---------

In the unlikely event you are thinking of building on this: STOP!
   
    DO NOT BUILD ON THIS CODE!
    
    EVERYTHING HERE IS ABOUT TO CHANGE...
    ...OR, POSSIBLY, I MIGHT GIVE UP.
    
    EITHER WAY, THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PROJECT IS WRONG. 
                IT CAN, AS-IS, GO LITTLE FURTHER.
	

More details/warnings you should heed:

The `trix.net.irc` package is undergoing radical reconstruction. Do
not count on anything here to work, remain stable, or... anything!


What I'm doing about this:

The second phase of utterly unreliable `irc` bot programming is 
beginning. I'll attempt to add a `Bot` class that will incorporate
all the important lessons I've learned so far. The new package will 
work in a totally different way from the original version, though
much of the original code will probably be used.


What I hope to achieve sooner or later:

I hope to eventually mark this `irc` package as stable, but for now
it's important to note:

    ANYTHING (OR EVEN EVERYTHING) IN THE `trix.net.irc` package may
    change significantly, disappear, fluctuate, gyrate, or otherwise
    disappoint you.
    
    DO NOT COUNT ON ANYTHING PRESENTED HERE!
    
    The old stuff will probably be removed as it is being rewritten 
    into the new stuff will be removed.
    
I'll definitely report here when anything seems even a little bit
stable. Until then... probably best to ignore this package for any
real, practical purpose.



### Original contents:

    This `irc` subpackage is under construction.
    It's still buggy, but closer than before.
    There's a long way to go yet.
