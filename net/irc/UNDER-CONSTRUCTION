This `irc` subpackage is under construction.

There's no IRC connectivity provided here yet, only parts of it that
I hope will be useful in the future.

Everything in the trix package is subject to change, but the things
that appear here are much more likely to change than other elements
of the project.

Even as is is, there are definitely lots of bugs in this code!
