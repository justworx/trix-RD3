X - Experimental Code/Files

The `x` package is meant to contain files/code that 
 * are experimental and may or may not become part of trix 
 * are under construction and may take a long time to update
 * may be useful later but is not currently needed

Basically it's a shared staging area, backed up on the git server,
identifiably volatile, experimental content and structure.
