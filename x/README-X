The `x` package contains experimental code.

I'm removing `x` from the .gitignore file because I spend too much
time looking for these items in backups - I'd rather have them here,
available, secure on this very very secure server.

That said...

DO NOT RELY ON ANY OF THIS CODE! 
It's very likely incomplete, buggy, dangerous, explosive, horrific, 
pshchodelic, lame, or otherwise not good. 

Remember also that, in the event it turns out to be none of those 
awful thinkgs, stable(ish) modules will be moved from `x` to a more
appropriate location in the trix (or possibly some other) package.

The `x` subpackage is intended ONLY for experimental and/or "under
construction" modules. Chances are, most of it will never become 
part of the trix package because I'm just throwing any old random 
thing in here - for in case I need it eventually sometime in the 
future, past, or never.
