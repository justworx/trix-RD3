To open trix as an application with the web browser as an interface,
we'll need a cline handler that does the following:

* Check whether the HttpUI server is running.
   - If it is, add the getpass.username/key combo directly to a
     list maintained by the HttpUI server object;
   - Otherwise, start up the HttpUI server to handle browser 
     requests and add the new username/key combo.

* Open a web browser to the (localhost only!) address of the web
  server, sending the key in the url.

* Webbrowser must set the key as a cookie. That's the authentication
  method for the "logged-in" user.
  
* All requests must be checked, so that the system user account can
  be access only his own data.


... I'm pretty sleepy atm - Need to go over this carefully to mae
    sure there are no holes in my logic.


# -----------------

python3
import webbrowser
from trix.x.httpui import *
s = HttpUI().starts()
webbrowser.open_new_tab("http://localhost:%i" % s.port)
