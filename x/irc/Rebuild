This x.irc will replace trix.net.irc.

It's pretty much the same, but hopefully less confusing/jumbled. I'm
not really sure how to do it except to make objects more descrete
and improve the inter-object communication.

I really need to develope an overall vision - net.irc was pretty much
just thrown together. A lot of new ideas kept popping in and things
got confused. Now I lrr[ typing to avoid coming up with that vision. 
I guess we'll see what happens. Hopefully tomorrow :)




NOW:
 - IrcConnect still holds unique set of plugins/config




I THINK...
 - I might want IrcConnect to be based on Runner as well as Connect;
   Client might have been a really bad idea.
 - Then again, Client reduces the number of threads in use... Isn't
   that a good thing?

 * I may be distracting myself. The purpose here is to clean up the
   code and make the irc package operation more clear.
 * Then again, threading IrcConnect might really serve that purpose.
